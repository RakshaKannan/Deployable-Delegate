# Emailer Design
This is a straightforward HTML design for a new email initiative.
To ensure it runs properly, please download the images and the HTML file to the same folder before opening. The emailer-class file has all the inline styling converted to CSS classes. 
The mailto feature will open the default email app installed on your computer. If you have none installed, then it will create a new mail in the account currently open in your browser.
